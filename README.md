# Academic Mad Libs Story Generator
Generate a Mad Libs story based on your school life! That is, if your school **uses Canvas (Instructure's LMS)!**


## Usage
*Because of how third-party apps works with Canvas LMS (on a per-institution install basis), you will have to obtain an **access token** from your account's settings page.*

(This app does not store any tokens nor modifies your data. It is deleted every refresh.)

### Getting an access token

### Using the App
1. Take the token you just got and input it into the input box of the app.
2. Click 'Submit' and enjoy a rad perspective of your school life!

To make a new story, refresh the page and repeat the process.

### Special Thanks
**Herman Fassett** (http://hermanfassett.me/) for his wonderful CORS-Anywhere and MadLibz APIs, which are the stars of this app!
